## Android Appliation

Android application that is designed for vehicle(Fleet) management. This application enables the user to create authentication base secure login using firebase & let the registered admins(e.g. owner of travel agency) track the other application users(drivers under registered agency) in real-time on google maps. Additionally it also enables all to communicate in real-time which is achieved by using Pub Nub APIs.It includes various useful features such as alerting and alarming on overspeeding.
Note: Android application was designed for Android 7.0 so it may warn you on new version as it's intended to use on lower Android version. Some features may not work as online hosted DB may no longer connect & may result in timeout.
